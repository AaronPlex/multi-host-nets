This is a repository for the global analysis of multi-host landscape connectivity.

1GBIF-host-density-individual.R 

* This R file provides the code to generate rasterized maps of a host species.

2Multi-host-density.R
  
* This R file provides the code to generate multi-host density maps from individual maps produced by 1GBIF-host-density-individual.R

3Host-connectivity.R

* This R file provides the code to run the multi-host connectivity analysis. Note that the connectivity analyses were run by the University of Florida HiPerGator using extensive computational resources.
